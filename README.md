# Test-Automation-Method-PSO

About the code: 

We apply Particle Swarm Optimization to do scenario-based test automation for highly automated vehicles.

Test ODD:
Car-following test ODD with 68,335 concrete scenarios.

System Under Test (SUT):

The SUT in our experiment is the rear-end collisions avoidance functionality fulfilled by a motion planning algorithm,named Intelligent Driver Model (IDM).
Here we provide the coda of IDM, and also provide the testing results in the whole Car-following test ODD.It can be used to efficiently verify implementation of PSO.
